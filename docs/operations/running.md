# Running the system

This repository exposes three Node entrypoints, two thin local review
frontends, one HTTP Docker compose profile, and one session-scoped Docker MCP
profile.

## Entrypoints

### HTTP API

```bash
corepack pnpm api
```

Entrypoint files:

- `apps/brain-api/src/main.ts`
- `apps/brain-api/src/server.ts`

The API listens on `MAB_API_HOST:MAB_API_PORT` and prints the bound address on startup.

### CLI

```bash
corepack pnpm cli -- version
corepack pnpm cli -- auth-status
```

Entrypoint file:

- `apps/brain-cli/src/main.ts`

The CLI is JSON-in / JSON-out for command handlers that accept payloads.

### MCP server

```bash
corepack pnpm mcp
```

Entrypoint files:

- `apps/brain-mcp/src/main.ts`
- `apps/brain-mcp/src/tool-definitions.ts`

This is a stdio MCP server that uses Content-Length framing.

If `corepack enable` cannot install a global `pnpm` shim on your machine, keep
using the `corepack pnpm ...` form shown above.

### Thin review frontends

The repository now also includes two thin operator frontends over the governed
review contract:

- Windows Tkinter reviewer: `scripts/review-note-gui.py`
- local Obsidian plugin: `integrations/obsidian/multi-agent-brain-review`

These frontends are intentionally shells over the same backend commands:

- `list-review-queue`
- `read-review-note`
- `accept-note`
- `reject-note`

They do not execute low-level review or promotion steps directly and do not move
files themselves.

#### Tkinter reviewer

Launch on Windows with a working Python that includes Tkinter:

```bash
py -3 scripts/review-note-gui.py
```

Useful environment overrides:

- `MAB_REVIEW_REPO_ROOT`
- `MAB_REVIEW_NODE_EXECUTABLE`

The script expects a built `brain-cli` and will fail fast if `apps/brain-cli/dist/main.js`
or the configured Node executable cannot be found.

This reviewer is documented and supported as a Windows-only local tool in the
current repository state.

#### Obsidian plugin

Tracked plugin source:

- `integrations/obsidian/multi-agent-brain-review`

To use it locally:

1. build the repo with `corepack pnpm build`
2. copy the plugin folder into your vault under `.obsidian/plugins/multi-agent-brain-review`
3. enable it in Obsidian
4. set `Repo root` in plugin settings

The plugin is desktop-only and intentionally has no baked-in machine-specific
repo path.

### Docker compose profile

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.local.yml up --build
```

Tracked runtime assets:

- `docker/brain-api.Dockerfile`
- `docker/compose.local.yml`

### Docker MCP session

```bash
docker run --rm -i ... multi-agent-brain-mcp-session:local
```

Tracked runtime assets:

- `docker/brain-mcp.Dockerfile`
- `docker/brain-mcp-session-entrypoint.mjs`
- `docker/brain-mcp-session.env.example`
- `docker/compose.mcp-session.yml`
- `docs/operations/docker-mcp-session.md`

## Runtime behavior

All three Node entrypoints build the same shared container through `packages/infrastructure/src/bootstrap/build-service-container.ts`.

The Docker MCP session wrapper validates the environment before launching
`apps/brain-mcp/dist/main.js`, but it does not replace the MCP server itself.

That shared container wires:

- auth policy
- orchestrator
- application services
- filesystem repositories
- SQLite-backed stores
- SQLite FTS
- Qdrant vector adapter
- local / paid provider adapters
- Python coding bridge

## Health endpoints

The HTTP adapter exposes:

- `GET /health/live`
- `GET /health/ready`

Health behavior comes from `packages/infrastructure/src/health/runtime-health.ts`.

### `live`

Checks:

- canonical vault directory access
- staging vault directory access
- SQLite reachability
- temporal-validity summary state
- Qdrant reachability

`live` returns:

- `200` for pass or degraded
- `503` for fail

Missing Qdrant is a warning in `live` mode, not an immediate fatal result.

### `ready`

Uses the same checks, but Qdrant failure is a fatal readiness issue.

`ready` returns:

- `200` only for pass
- `503` for degraded or fail

## Docker MCP readiness

The Docker MCP session profile does not expose HTTP health endpoints.

Readiness is defined by successful preflight validation in
`docker/brain-mcp-session-entrypoint.mjs`.

Validation covers:

- explicit env contract
- mount-backed canonical, staging, state, and config paths
- fixed session actor binding against the file-backed actor registry
- Qdrant reachability
- model endpoint reachability plus required model presence
- Python runtime availability

If any of those checks fail, the container exits before the MCP stdio server is
started.

## Auth-control surfaces

Operator/admin surfaces reachable through the HTTP adapter:

- `GET /v1/system/auth`
- `GET /v1/system/auth/issued-tokens`
- `POST /v1/system/auth/issue-token`
- `POST /v1/system/auth/introspect-token`
- `POST /v1/system/auth/revoke-token`
- `GET /v1/system/freshness`
- `GET /v1/system/version`

The CLI exposes the same categories through commands such as `auth-status`, `auth-issued-tokens`, `issue-auth-token`, `auth-introspect-token`, `revoke-auth-token`, and `freshness-status`.

## Storage locations

Primary runtime state is stored in:

- canonical notes under `MAB_VAULT_ROOT`
- staging drafts under `MAB_STAGING_ROOT`
- SQLite state under `MAB_SQLITE_PATH`
- Qdrant collection named by `MAB_QDRANT_COLLECTION`

The workspace you are reading may also contain local untracked `vault/` content. That is workspace state, not tracked repository content.

## Background work and schedulers

The tracked repository does not contain a standalone worker or scheduler process.

Notable consequence:

- promotion outbox replay exists as service logic in `packages/application/src/services/promotion-orchestrator-service.ts`
- there is no tracked daemon or scheduled job that replays pending promotions out of process

## Coding runtime

Coding tasks route through:

- `packages/orchestration/src/coding/coding-domain-controller.ts`
- `packages/infrastructure/src/coding/python-coding-controller-bridge.ts`
- `runtimes/local_experts/bridge.py`

This flow starts a Python subprocess and passes task payloads through JSON stdin/stdout.

## Evidence status

### Verified facts

- Entrypoints come from the tracked `apps/*/src/main.ts` files and root package scripts
- Health behavior comes from `packages/infrastructure/src/health/runtime-health.ts`
- Shared runtime wiring comes from `packages/infrastructure/src/bootstrap/build-service-container.ts`

### Assumptions

- None

### TODO gaps

- If a dedicated worker/scheduler is added, document it here and in `docs/reference/repo-map.md`
