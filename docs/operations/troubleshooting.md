# Troubleshooting

This file focuses on failures that are directly supported by tracked code and tests.

## The process ignores my `.env` file

Symptom:

- you create `.env`
- the app still uses defaults or missing environment values

Cause:

- the Node apps call `loadEnvironment(process.env)` and do not load dotenv files

What to do:

- export variables in your shell before running `corepack pnpm api`, `corepack pnpm cli`, or `corepack pnpm mcp`
- or pass them through Docker / your process manager

## `corepack enable` fails or `pnpm` is unavailable

Symptom:

- `corepack enable` fails to install shims
- `pnpm` is not found even though Node and Corepack are installed

Cause:

- your machine blocks shim installation or the configured Node tool directory is not writable

What to do:

- run workspace commands as `corepack pnpm ...` directly
- example: `corepack pnpm install`, `corepack pnpm cli -- version`, `corepack pnpm test`

## `docker compose -f docker/compose.mcp-session.yml config` fails immediately

Symptom:

- compose validation exits before starting the session container
- the error points at unset `MAB_HOST_*` or `MAB_FIXED_SESSION_*` variables

Cause:

- `docker/compose.mcp-session.yml` intentionally uses required variable checks for explicit host mounts and the fixed session actor contract

What to do:

- copy `docker/brain-mcp-session.env.example` to `docker/brain-mcp-session.env`
- set the host canonical, staging, state, and auth config paths explicitly
- set the fixed session actor id, source, and token contract explicitly
- validate again before launching the MCP client

## The app writes outside the repo on Windows

Symptom:

- canonical notes appear under `F:\Dev\AI Context Brain`

Cause:

- `packages/infrastructure/src/config/env.ts` uses that as the Windows default when `MAB_VAULT_ROOT` is unset

What to do:

- set `MAB_VAULT_ROOT` explicitly for repo-local development

## `GET /health/live` is degraded or `GET /health/ready` fails

Common cause:

- Qdrant is unavailable

Behavior:

- `live` treats Qdrant failure as a warning
- `ready` treats Qdrant failure as a failure

What to do:

- start Qdrant
- or accept degraded vector retrieval for local development and do not use readiness as your only signal

## Retrieval warnings mention expired or future-dated evidence

Cause:

- retrieval includes note freshness warnings from `RetrieveContextService`
- runtime health also warns on expired, future-dated, or expiring-soon current-state notes

What to do:

- inspect freshness through `GET /v1/system/freshness` or `corepack pnpm cli -- freshness-status`
- create governed refresh drafts instead of mutating canonical notes directly

## `401 unauthorized` or `403 forbidden` on API, CLI, or MCP

Interpretation:

- `401` usually means missing, inactive, revoked, or unrecognized credentials
- `403` usually means the actor is known but not allowed to use the requested role, command, transport, or admin action

What to check:

- `MAB_AUTH_MODE`
- actor registry contents
- source binding
- allowed transport / command / admin-action lists
- token validity windows
- revocation state

Helpful surfaces:

- `corepack pnpm cli -- auth-status`
- `corepack pnpm cli -- auth-issued-tokens`
- `corepack pnpm cli -- auth-introspect-token --json ...`
- `GET /v1/system/auth`
- `POST /v1/system/auth/introspect-token`

## `draft_note` behaves differently with and without models

Observed behavior:

- when no drafting provider is configured, `StagingDraftService` generates a deterministic fallback body with reviewable section text
- when a drafting provider is configured, it uses provider output first and then validates it
- draft ingress rejects placeholder-only required sections such as `TBD.`, `TODO`, or `Placeholder.`

What to do:

- if you want predictable no-model behavior, set `MAB_DRAFTING_PROVIDER=disabled`
- if draft creation now fails with `validation_failed`, inspect required sections first; placeholder scaffolds no longer pass ingress validation
- if you want model-backed drafting, configure the provider endpoint and model variables explicitly

## `promote_note` fails because a draft is not promotion-ready

Observed behavior:

- promotion now checks explicit review metadata before it will touch canonical memory
- a staged draft can exist in SQLite and still be non-promotable

What to do:

- if you are reviewing through a thin frontend, use `accept-note` instead of replaying the lower-level workflow yourself
- run `classify-note-ingress` first if the candidate path is ambiguous
- create the draft through `draft-note`
- for high-risk drafts, mark it with `review-draft-note` using `approve_draft` first and `set_promotion_ready` second
- retry `promote-note` only after the review step succeeds

## `promote_note` says the draft must be reviewed again for the latest revision

Observed behavior:

- promotion is now bound to the revision that was explicitly reviewed
- if the draft changes after review, the earlier `promotion_ready` decision is no longer enough

What to do:

- if you are using the thin review frontend, press `Accept` again after re-reading the current draft revision
- review the updated draft again through `review-draft-note`
- advance it back through `approve_draft` and then `set_promotion_ready`
- retry promotion only after the draft's current revision matches the reviewed revision

## `review-draft-note` or `promote-note` says the draft governance identity no longer matches the admitted staging contract

Observed behavior:

- once a draft is admitted, its note type, corpus, scope, current-state intent, and initial governance basis are treated as immutable
- review and promotion now reject drafts if those admitted governance fields drift afterward

What to do:

- inspect the staged draft file and compare its frontmatter to the originally admitted draft metadata
- if the drift was accidental, restore the original governance fields and rerun review
- if the note truly needs a different corpus, type, scope, or governance basis, create a new staged draft instead of mutating the old one in place

## `classify-note-ingress` or `draft-note` rejects a high-risk candidate for missing provenance

Observed behavior:

- note ingress now persists structured source-basis metadata and supporting note refs
- `classify-note-ingress` can infer `noteType` and `targetCorpus` when those hints are omitted and the candidate is strong enough
- high-risk note types can be downgraded or blocked when their required source basis is missing
- low-information session residue can be downgraded to `session_only`
- raw transcript-like captures can be rejected outright instead of entering durable staging

What to do:

- if `classify-note-ingress` can infer the note cleanly, reuse its returned `noteType`, `targetCorpus`, and normalized `scope` when you move on to `draft-note`
- provide `sourceBasis` explicitly when the note depends on `repo_inspection`, `user_instruction`, `retrieved_note`, or another governed basis
- include `supportingSources` when the candidate is grounded in existing notes, and include `chunkId` when you have chunk-level evidence available
- add a specific scope, summary, or body hints when a vague high-risk candidate is returned as `rewrite_required`
- keep raw transcript residue in a session archive or distilled handoff note instead of retrying it as a durable draft
- refine the candidate and retry if the response comes back as `rewrite_required` or `session_only`
- once the draft has been admitted, do not replace its initial provenance basis in place; create a new draft if the evidence set materially changes

## `draft-note` says the candidate is a `merge_candidate`

Observed behavior:

- draft ingress now computes duplicate identity hashes before staging admission
- exact duplicates and governed semantic duplicates are rejected before they create extra staging drafts

What to do:

- inspect `error.details.ingressDecision.mergeHints` to see the conflicting draft or canonical note IDs and paths
- review the existing note first instead of creating a second copy
- either merge into the existing draft, rewrite the candidate so its scope or summary is materially different, or discard the duplicate request

## Coding tasks fail or escalate immediately

Common causes:

- Python executable not found
- missing Python dependencies in the vendored runtime
- coding model endpoint unavailable
- runtime timeout

What to check:

- `MAB_CODING_RUNTIME_PYTHON_EXECUTABLE`
- `MAB_CODING_RUNTIME_PYTHONPATH`
- `MAB_CODING_RUNTIME_MODULE`
- `MAB_CODING_RUNTIME_TIMEOUT_MS`
- Python dependencies noted in `runtimes/local_experts/README.md`

## A transport surface exists in code but not in docs

Known risk areas:

- transport surfaces changed faster than the old adapter READMEs and planning docs

What to do:

- trust `apps/brain-api/src/server.ts`, `apps/brain-cli/src/main.ts`, and `apps/brain-mcp/src/tool-definitions.ts`
- update `docs/reference/interfaces.md` when you change any transport surface

## The repo map seems to disagree with the workspace

Possible reason:

- your local workspace may include untracked helper files such as `.codesight/`, `vault/`, or local notes

What to do:

- use `git status --short` to separate tracked repository content from local workspace residue

## Evidence status

### Verified facts

- Every issue listed here is grounded in tracked code, root scripts, or tracked tests
- Auth behavior is enforced by `packages/orchestration/src/root/actor-authorization-policy.ts`
- Health behavior is implemented in `packages/infrastructure/src/health/runtime-health.ts`

### Assumptions

- None

### TODO gaps

- If the repo adds CI or a standard launcher that reads `.env`, add those failure modes here
